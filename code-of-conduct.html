<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>Oxford Geek Night is a community meetup intended for networking, collaboration and mentoring. Oxford Geek Night is primarily focused on providing a comfortable collaboration space for everyone. Oxford Geek Night aims to make the tech industry more welcoming by creating a diverse community of peers and role models. Oxford Geek Night is a transgender inclusive meetup.</p>

<p>We value the participation of each member of our community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. All attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the meetup and at any related events.</p>

<p>To make clear what is expected, all attendees, speakers, organisers and volunteers at any OGN meetup are required to follow our Code of Conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the meetup.</p>

<h2>The Short Version</h2>

<p>OGN is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>

<p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any part of the meetup, including talks.</p>

<p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.</p>

<p>Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave at the sole discretion of the organisers.</p>

<p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>

<h2>The Longer Version</h2>

<p>Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion; it also includes sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>Organisers, volunteers, sponsors or similar are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, presenters should not use sexualised images, activities, or create a sexualised environment.</p>

<p>Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate in this meetup.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the meetup organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion.</p>
